# Design Rationale

- **Database Choice:** SQLite with Better-SQLite3 for simplicity and portability, enabling a single-file DB without external setup.
- **Schema:** The `tasks` table enforces data integrity with CHECK constraints on priority and status. `id` is auto-incrementing for unique identification.
- **Insights Logic:** Rule-based summary aggregates open tasks, priority distribution, and due dates. It identifies dominant priorities (>50% threshold) and highlights urgent tasks, providing basic analytical "AI-like" feedback without LLMs.
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript for lightweight, dependency-free UI. Uses Fetch API for async API calls and DOM manipulation for interactivity.
- **Security/Validation:** Basic backend validation for required fields; no advanced features like authentication as not specified.
